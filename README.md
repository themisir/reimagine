# reimagine

Gallery management software, inspired by [Picasa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasa) and modern cloud alternatives.

## Goal

Instead of relying on cloud infrastructure, this project focuses on trying to provide the experience locally on your device. Despite growing popularity, there's still niche group of people preferring to save their memories locally or on a NAS. This software aims to help those people by providing discoverability features.

The project has multiple goals that we are aiming to achieve in multiple phrases:

* Phrase 1 - foundation
  - Discovering images from specified root directories
  - Indexing images by embeded metadata: shooting date, camera details, scene details, geocoordinates
  - Rest API frontend for interacting with the core service
* Phrase 2 - intelligent labeling
  - Face detection and grouping by similar faces
  - Object detection and grouping by similar objects
* Phrase 3 - UX
  - Web based interface for exploring galleries
  - Mobile app for maintaining local galleries
  - Mobile app for importing from & exporting galleries into remote machines

Sounds too good to be true isn't it? Indeed, that's why I will need support from community to expand the product, especially for the third phrase.

## License

Undetermined at the moment of writing, will be decided upon public expansion decision.
